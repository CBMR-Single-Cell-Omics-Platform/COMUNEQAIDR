These sequences were manually processed. "AT" was added to the end of every sequence, and a "fake" matching i5 sequence "AGATCTCGGT" was added. 
The "AT" is the sequence following the i7 index and the fake i5 is the sequence obtained when the adapter is sequenced. This allows these indexes
to be used simultaneously with the Dual_Index_Kit_TT_Set_A.csv and Single_Index_Kit_T_Set_A.csv removing the need for demultiplexing twice.
